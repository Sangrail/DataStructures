# DataStructures

This is a set of projects (and associated unit tests) that delve into datastructures.

The first stage focuses on simple data structures:

* Linked Lists:
  * Single
  * Double
  * Circular
  
Then we move into data structures that are built on linked lists. For example:
* Stack
* Queues
